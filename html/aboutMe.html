                &emsp; Welcome, My name is Alex Balogh. I recently graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor of science 
                degree. My major is in Information Technology with 3 tracks; Game Development, Software Development, and Cybersecurity. 
                I grew up in Hilliard, Ohio which is to the west of Columbus, Ohio. I decided to go to the University of Cincinnati because 
                I really liked the campus and the Co-op Program.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; I became a gamer when I first started playing Minecraft. Years later I figured out that I want to make video games.
                Ever since playing Minecraft I had a dream to create video games that would bring in the next generation of video gamers. 
                I want to be apart of something that bring people to the gaming community. I felt that if I could make video games then I 
                could make a game that brings people to video games like Minecraft did for me. Now I play a wide variety of games but still 
                play Minecraft whenever I can. It is still one of my favorite games. My favorite games are Minecraft, The Sims 4, Roblox, 
                Ark: Survival Evolved, and Forza 5. I have so many other games that I love but those are the games I have been playing recently.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; I have designed a couple of games and made a couple of custom worlds in Minecraft. <a class="links" href="dndMap.html">Enchantia</a> 
                and an <a class="links" href="parkourMap.html">Achievement Parkour</a> course. Enchantia is a DnD campaign I am creating and wanted to build 
                a map and world so that I can visualize where things are. The Achievemnt Parkour course is a map that I have been building where 
                each level is a different achievement in Minecraft. These are explained more on another page under Minecraft Specific. I have 
                also been working on a text based game called <a class="links" href="goneText.html">Gone</a>. I have started building it as a 
                <a class="links" href="gone2d.html">2D top down game</a> as well. These are also talked about more indepth under the Created Games section. I 
                also have built a couple websites. One is a <a class="links" href="sims4Guide.html">Sims 4 guide</a> that has a lot of information about 
                things you can do like cheat codes, easter eggs, job rank ups, and some other things. 
                <br><br>
                &emsp; Outside of tech, I love to play Disc golf with my friends. I recently got into it and bought a set of 5 discs from Amazon 
                that gave me a variety of types. Then I got some more from a disc golf store that was on the last hole of one of the courses I 
                played. I am a fan of Soccer. My main teams are the Columbus Crew, Atletico Madrid, and the USMNT. In 2024 I was able to go to 
                my first Columbus Crew game. I also enjoy watching UC football and Ohio State Football.
