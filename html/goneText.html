                &emsp; Gone is a game that I started in high school with a group called Explorers Post 891. Explorers Posts 
                are a career-focused group that is adjacent to Boy Scouts. This specific one was for programming and coding. 
                When I was starting to learn C, I wanted to apply it to something. I wanted to make games so I was talsked 
                to use C to make a Text-Based game. Once I learned Python I decided to move it over especially since C was 
                starting to become irrelevant. Gone is a puzzle story game where you will explore a world where everyone in 
                it has disappeared. Your job is to go around the world and see if you can figure out where everyone has gone. 
                You explore the world to find clues and solve puzzles. I stopped after I got a couple of rooms built and basic 
                movement then I got busy and moved on to other projects.
