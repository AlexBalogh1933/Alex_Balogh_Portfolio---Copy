                &emsp; For a while, I knew I needed to make a portfolio to be able to display all my work and projects. 
                When I was trying to figure out how I wanted to present them I decided what better way than to make a 
                webpage so that I could use my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in building it. Building this site gave 
                me a lot more experience using the IDE, Visual Studio Code. It also helped me gain more experience using 
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also using GitHub for source control. It is something that I feel 
                comfortable with and helps me make it so that I can edit it from any computer. I enjoyed building this 
                portfolio and getting everything that I have worked on together and put in one place. With building this 
                site I have started to continue working on my Sims 4 Guide since some of the pages are only half complete 
                and out of date.
