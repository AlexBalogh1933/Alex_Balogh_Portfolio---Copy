                &emsp; For my Web Development class, our main project was to create a website. My first idea was a page with more 
                information about the Sims 4. This page has a couple of different pages including Skills, Cheats, Challenges, and 
                Easter Eggs. There are a lot of different pages with information about the Sims 4 but you have to go through all 
                the different pages. This page is used to combine a lot of the different things you would want to know about the 
                game.

                    This is the home page of the website. It has the Official Gameplay Trailer for the Sims 4, a quick description
                    of the website, and a couple of gameplay images. In the images on this page, I have one where a group of Sims
                    are watching TV. One of them all sitting outside. Another of a couple of Sims exploring a maze. Then finally
                    there is one of them all dancing. At the top of the page, I have a navigation bar to get to the other pages on
                    the website.

                    are a part of different packs. There are a couple of images that have some of the skills in use. The first image 
                    on this page shows off the Cooking skill. The next one shows the Painting skills and the Video Gaming skills. The 
                    next image is of the Active skill and the final picture shows the Dancing skill and Mixology skill.

                    specific image is of the Skills Cheats. There are many different cheats that you can use in the Sims 4. This
                    page has most of the skills that I use most and some that are helpful for building or for playing.
